## ⚠️ Troubleshooting Upload

### "Could not read QR code from this image"
**Possible causes:**
- Image quality too low (blurry/pixelated)
- QR code too small in the image
- Image doesn't contain a QR code
- QR code is damaged/corrupted

**Solutions:**
1. Take a clearer photo
2. Crop the image to show only the QR code
3. Ensure good lighting when taking photo
4. Try the Camera Scan method instead

### Upload button not responding
1. Check if file is an image format
2. Try a different browser
3. Clear browser cache
4. Use Camera Scan as alternative

## 🎯 Tips for Best Results

### Image Quality
- ✅ **High resolution**: Clear, sharp images work best
- ✅ **Close crop**: Less background, focus on QR code
- ✅ **Good contrast**: Dark QR on light background
- ❌ **Avoid**: Blurry, dark, or heavily compressed images

### File Formats
- **Best**: PNG (lossless, high quality)
- **Good**: JPG (widely supported)
- **OK**: WEBP, BMP, GIF
- **Recommended size**: Under 5MB

### Taking Photos
- Hold phone steady
- Get close to QR code
- Ensure good lighting
- Keep QR code centered
- Avoid reflections/glare
